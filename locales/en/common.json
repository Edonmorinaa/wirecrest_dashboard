Reviews are scored from -1 to 1, where: Positive > 0.33, Neutral = -0.33 to 0.33, and Negative < -0.33. This helps identify emotional trends in customer feedback.",
  "sentiment-analysis-suggestion": "Monitor negative sentiment trends to identify areas for improvement. A sudden increase in negative sentiment might indicate a specific issue that needs immediate attention.",
  
  "popular-keywords-explanation": "Keywords are extracted from review text to identify common themes and topics. The system counts how often each keyword appears across all reviews, then displays the top 5 most frequently mentioned terms. This helps identify what aspects of your service customers talk about most.",
  "popular-keywords-suggestion": "Use positive keywords in your marketing and address negative ones in your service improvements. If certain keywords appear frequently in negative reviews, they may indicate areas needing immediate attention."
