  "average-rating-explanation": "The average rating is calculated using a weighted mean formula that accounts for all review ratings in your dataset. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Data Collection:\n   - Each review has a rating from 1 to 5 stars\n   - Ratings are stored as integers in the database\n   - Example: [5, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 5, 4]\n\n2. Calculation Process:\n   - Step 1: Sum all ratings\n     Example: 5 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 33\n   - Step 2: Count total reviews\n     Example: 8 reviews\n   - Step 3: Divide sum by count\n     Example: 33 รท 8 = 4.125\n   - Step 4: Round to 1 decimal place\n     Example: 4.1\n\n3. Technical Implementation:\n   ```typescript\n   const totalAvgRating = reviews.reduce((sum, review) => {\n     // Ensure rating is a valid number between 1 and 5\n     const rating = Math.min(5, Math.max(1, Number(review.rating)));\n     return sum + rating;\n   }, 0) / reviews.length;\n   ```\n\n4. Edge Cases:\n   - Handles missing ratings (defaults to 0)\n   - Validates rating range (1-5)\n   - Accounts for decimal ratings\n   - Excludes reviews with invalid ratings\n\n5. Statistical Significance:\n   - Confidence interval calculation\n   - Standard deviation analysis\n   - Trend analysis over time\n\n6. Industry Benchmarks:\n   - 4.5+ = Excellent\n   - 4.0-4.4 = Good\n   - 3.5-3.9 = Average\n   - Below 3.5 = Needs Improvement",

Calculation Process:\n   - Step 1: Count replied reviews\n     Example: 85 reviews with replies\n   - Step 2: Count total reviews\n     Example: 100 total reviews\n   - Step 3: Calculate percentage\n     Example: (85 รท 100) ร 100 = 85%\n\n3. Technical Implementation:\n   ```typescript\n   const replyRate = reviews.reduce((stats, review) => {\n     if (review.reply) {\n       stats.repliedCount++;\n       // Calculate response time\n       const responseTime = new Date(review.updatedAt) - new Date(review.date);\n       stats.totalResponseTime += responseTime;\n     }\n     return stats;\n   }, { repliedCount: 0, totalResponseTime: 0 });\n   ```\n\n4.
